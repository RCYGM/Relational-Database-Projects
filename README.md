# Relational-Database-Projects

## Project Description

In these courses, I used professional development tools such as Visual Studio Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux/Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build practical projects.

I mastered essential terminal commands, from navigating and manipulating a file system to programming in Bash and performing advanced tasks, optimizing my workflow and automating key processes.

Additionally, I designed and managed relational databases with PostgreSQL, using SQL as the language to interact with these databases. I learned how to structure, query, and automate data management efficiently and professionally.

Finally, I worked with Git, the version control system, which allowed me to manage my code securely and collaborate on projects effectively, consolidating essential skills for any developer.

Below, I will present my learning path, organized from the most recent course to the oldest, showing how I progressively built my knowledge step by step.
