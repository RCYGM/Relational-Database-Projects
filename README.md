# Relational-Database-Projects

## Bash Project - 170 Lessons

### Project Description

The terminal allows you to send text commands to your computer to manipulate the file system, run programs, automate tasks, and much more.

In this **170-lesson** course, I learned the essential terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate structure using only the command line.

### What I Learned

1. **Terminal Navigation**

   - Commands to move between directories and list files.

2. **File and Directory Management**

   - Creating, deleting, and manipulating files and folders directly from the terminal.

3. **Task Automation**

   - Using scripts to execute repetitive processes and simplify workflows.

4. **Building a Website Structure**
   - Creating a complete website boilerplate, organizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Mario Database Project -165 Lessons

### Project Description

This project involved designing, creating, and managing a relational database in **PostgreSQL** to model information related to characters, actions, and sounds from the Mario universe. Through this project, I applied fundamental concepts of relational databases and SQL queries to explore and manipulate data effectively.

### What I Learned

1. **Relational Database Fundamentals**

   - Created and managed tables with "one-to-one," "one-to-many," and "many-to-many" relationships.

2. **Schema Design and Constraints**

   - Used `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, and `UNIQUE` constraints to ensure data integrity.
   - Modeled junction tables for complex relationships.

3. **SQL Queries**

   - Built complex queries using `JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables.
   - Filtered, selected, and sorted data using `WHERE` and `ORDER BY`.

4. **Data Export and Import**

   - Utilized tools like `pg_dump` to create `.sql` files for sharing and migrating the database.

5. **Relationship Modeling**
   - Designed "one-to-one" relationships between tables like `characters` and `more_info`.
   - Implemented "many-to-many" relationships using junction tables like `character_actions`.
